## About
Built on the Ethereum blockchain, the DApp leverages the power of smart contracts to streamline the claims process, ensuring transparency and efficiency.

2. Leveraging technology for claims processing can lead to automation, reducing errors and speeding up the overall claims settlement process.

## Functionality & Concepts
- The fully-responsive DApp, created via tailwind CSS and React JS, has a very simple and interactive interface that uses advanced features in different activities involving the transactions and claims.
- Patients can submit their medical bills directly to the blockchain. Each submission generates a unique claim ID and records details such as the patient's address, hospital admin's address, and the NFT ID associated with the claim.
- Hospital administrators can verify the submitted bills. Upon verification, the claim amount is set, marking the bill as verified.
- Once the bill is verified by the hospital, the insurance company can process the claim. The claim amount is transferred directly to the patient's Ethereum address.
- The different variants and all parameters of the policy claims have been considered.
